## Digital Distraction Self Analyzer
## Overview

The Digital Distraction Self Analyzer is a Python-based self-assessment tool designed to help users analyze and understand their digital usage behavior.
The project evaluates how time spent on mobile phones, social media, and other digital platforms impacts productivity, focus, and academic performance.

This project promotes self-awareness and responsible digital habits using simple analytics and rule-based evaluation.

## Problem Statement

With the increasing use of smartphones and social media, many students experience:

Reduced focus and concentration

Poor time management

Increased screen dependency

Lower academic productivity

However, users often lack a clear understanding of their digital habits.
This project helps identify the level of digital distraction and provides practical recommendations for improvement.

## Objectives

Analyze daily digital usage patterns

Identify levels of distraction

Categorize users into productivity levels

Provide suggestions to reduce digital distraction

Encourage balanced and mindful technology usage

## Features

Accepts user inputs related to:

Screen time

Social media usage

Study duration

## Classifies distraction level:

Low

Moderate

High

Displays productivity feedback

Provides improvement suggestions

Simple and user-friendly interaction

Fully beginner-friendly Python project

## Technologies Used

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

Core Python concepts:

Conditional statements

User input handling

Logical decision-making

Output formatting

## How the System Works

User enters:

Daily screen time (in hours)

Social media usage time

Study or productive hours

The system evaluates inputs using predefined rules

Based on analysis, it determines:

Distraction level

Productivity score

Personalized suggestions are displayed

## Sample Output
Enter total screen time (hours): 6
Enter social media usage (hours): 3
Enter study hours: 2

Distraction Level : High
Productivity Status : Needs Improvement

Suggestions:
- Reduce social media usage
- Follow a fixed study schedule
- Take regular digital breaks
- Use focus techniques like Pomodoro

## Use Cases
